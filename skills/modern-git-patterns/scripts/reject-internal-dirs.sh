# NOTE on symlinked dirs: Blocked dirs may be symlinks to the bare repo root

Usage: $PROG_NAME [OPTIONS]

Pre-commit hook that blocks files matching patterns in .gitblock from being
committed. Designed for use with pre-commit framework or as a standalone
git hook.

Options:
  -h, --help     Show this help message and exit
  -t, --test     Dry-run: show which staged files would be rejected (exit 0)

Setup:
  1. Create .gitblock at the repo root (gitignore syntax):
       internal-dir/         # block directory
       secrets.json          # block specific file
       *.key                 # block by glob
       !allowed.key          # allowlist exception

  2a. Wire as git config-based hook [2.54+] (absolute path required):
       git config --local hook.reject-internal-dirs.event pre-commit
       git config --local hook.reject-internal-dirs.command "$(pwd)/scripts/reject-internal-dirs.sh"
       NOTE: In bare+worktree setups, config hooks run from \$GIT_DIR (no
       working tree). Use pre-commit framework (2c) instead for project hooks.

  2b. Wire into .pre-commit-config.yaml:
       - id: reject-internal-dirs
         name: Reject internal directories
         entry: bash scripts/reject-internal-dirs.sh
         language: system
         pass_filenames: false
         always_run: true

  2c. Wire as traditional .git/hooks/pre-commit:
       cp scripts/reject-internal-dirs.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
       chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

  3. Exclude .gitblock from tracking:
       echo ".gitblock" >> .git/info/exclude

Exit codes:
  0  No blocked files found (or --help, --test)
  1  Blocked files detected in staging area
