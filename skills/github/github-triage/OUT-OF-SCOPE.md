# Out-of-Scope Knowledge Base

The `.out-of-scope/` directory in a repo stores persistent records of rejected feature requests. It serves two purposes:

1. **Institutional memory** — why a feature was rejected, so the reasoning isn't lost when the issue is closed
2. **Deduplication** — when a new issue comes in that matches a prior rejection, the skill can surface the previous decision

## Directory structure

```
.out-of-scope/
├── dark-mode.md
├── plugin-system.md
└── graphql-api.md
```

One file per **concept**, not per issue.

## File format

```markdown
# Dark Mode

This project does not support dark mode or user-facing theming.

## Why this is out of scope

The rendering pipeline assumes a single color palette defined in
`ThemeConfig`. Supporting multiple themes would require:

- A theme context provider wrapping the entire component tree
- Per-component theme-aware style resolution
- A persistence layer for user theme preferences

## Prior requests

- #42 — "Add dark mode support"
- #87 — "Night theme for accessibility"
```

### Naming the file

Use a short, descriptive kebab-case name for the concept. The name should be recognizable enough that someone browsing the directory understands what was rejected without opening the file.

### Writing the reason

The reason should be substantive — not "we don't want this" but why. Good reasons reference:

- Project scope or philosophy
- Technical constraints
- Strategic decisions

The reason should be durable. Avoid referencing temporary circumstances.

## When to check `.out-of-scope/`

During triage (Step 1: Gather context), read all files in `.out-of-scope/`. When evaluating a new issue:

- Check if the request matches an existing out-of-scope concept
- Matching is by concept similarity, not keyword
- If there's a match, surface it to the maintainer

## When to write to `.out-of-scope/`

Only when an **enhancement** (not a bug) is rejected as `wontfix`:

1. Maintainer decides a feature request is out of scope
2. Check if a matching `.out-of-scope/` file already exists
3. If yes: append the new issue to the "Prior requests" list
4. If no: create a new file with the concept name, decision, reason, and first prior request
5. Post a comment on the issue explaining the decision
6. Close the issue with the `wontfix` label

## Updating or removing out-of-scope files

If the maintainer changes their mind:

- Delete the `.out-of-scope/` file
- The new issue that triggered the reconsideration proceeds through normal triage
